# Django-Rest-Framework-Authentication
This project explains working of Django's Rest framework authentication system. We do API authentication using JWT tokens. We create a custom user class that modifies existing Django's base User class to login using email.



Step 1: 
Run the virtual Environment:

source env/bin/activate

Step 2: Install all dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Run the migrations and create database

python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate

Step 4: Run the server

python3 manage.py runserver

A unique JWT token is generated if valid credentials are passed. We create a custom cookie variable to store a token inside it.

And finally the logout view. Here the cookie is completely destroyed using the built-in delete_cookie method.

Finally the cookie is destroyed when the user logs out of the application.
